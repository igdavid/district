                <section><h2> To resolve and prevent the widening of the health-wealth gap in the Philippines</h2>
                <p> As the dawn breaks through the horizon, I am often reminded of the whole world’s attempt to accomplish an unfinished jigsaw puzzle. In my entire existence, oppression has always been the ultimate mystery and a seemingly concrete truth that is far beyond cure. As the human race carries on its relentless pursuit of perfection, we often neglect the multitude of factors where oppression and maltreatment stem from. Yet, should these instances even exist when the health and physical well-being of people are on the line?</p>

                <p> Consider these occurrences: the lack of money, the inability to afford basic health services and medical needs, and the incapacity to pay for medical bills. These are all familiar scenes in the healthcare sector of the Philippines which led to the increasing cases of deaths concerning the health of those who live at the lowest stratum of society. Take into account the rampant corruption which happens behind the scenes, there may not be anything left for the poorest of the poor.</p>

                <p> Numbers, as they say, signify vital information that our minds could not envision. Out of the 90 million people living in the Philippines, most of them are not capable of affording basic health services. With only 1,071 licensed private hospitals and 721 public hospitals, these facilities may not be enough to accommodate and provide medical services to the poverty-stricken families in the Philippines.</p>

                <p> In my most honest proposals, which I think everyone would agree to, I have arrived at the point where abolition is society’s only way to achieve perfection. First, in order to prevent the widening of the health-wealth gap prevalent in the Philippines, one must abolish the health care privileges possessed by those who casually sit at the topmost shelf of the social pyramid. This entails that the rich will never have any access to health services similar to what the impoverished families are deprived from. This will assure that the gap, which is present in today’s society, will disappear from view. This will ensure fair treatment across all people of various socio-economic backgrounds once these advantages have been eradicated.</p>

                <p> Second, terminate those who work in the field of health care and medicine. Inside the arena, these professionals continue to discover and unravel diseases. They continue to formulate cure and medicines, but at what cost? Maybe to provide solutions to the inevitable course taken by fatal and transmissible diseases. If these professionals put an end to their efforts towards coming up with a cure, a greater chance is that everyone will not get a hold of the best type of medicinal solution; thus, both the fortunate and the needy will suffer without the advantages enjoyed by the former.</p>
                
                <p> Third, I am acquainted with the predicaments which surround the destitute families and their constant war against an enemy. This path leads me to propose the provision of opportunities for far-flung patients and their access to universal health care through the developments of mobile hospitals for monthly check-ups and the purchase of medicine. These people persistently consider the cost of transportation if they would have to travel long distances for the sole purpose of having their health and physical well-being checked. Yet, if such innovations were to be made, these will provide equal opportunities for the less fortunate as these will take away the unnecessary cost of transportation, and the fee may then be used for the purchase of medicine and pharmaceutical drugs</p>
                    
                <p> Lastly, health care reform is something the nation yearns. The creation of laws and policies, which will grant universal and free health care as well as financial aid to the poor and their children, is a solution that will aid in preventing the widening of the health-wealth gap in the Philippines. Countless administrations had passed and numerous reforms and policies have been implemented. Yet, why do we ceaselessly encounter issues and maltreatment in the health care sector of the Philippines? Reforms, policies, and laws that grant universal health care to Filipinos must target the enemy in order to ensure that all Filipino citizens, may they be rich or poor, are guaranteed equitable and fair access to affordable health services and needs. In addition to the benefits of the implementation of laws and policies, Filipinos will be protected and secured from financial risks and problems which have restrained them for years on end. </p>
                    
                <p> I am fully aware of the violent reactions and feelings which may arise towards these proposals of mine. Yet, I duly respect those opinions and would gladly take into consideration those which deviate from my desires. These solutions, however, provide the best possible ways to put an end to the widening of the health-wealth gap in the Philippines. These solutions will drive the interests of the poor families towards the best. Similar to how society often aims for perfection, these changes and reforms are stepping stones which will bring the world one step forward in unraveling the mystery and accomplishing an unfinished jigsaw puzzle. </p>
